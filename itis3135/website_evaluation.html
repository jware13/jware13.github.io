            <p class="evaluation-text">This is the Bungie landing page for their game Destiny 2. The landing page shows a current trailer of the current season
                as well as this weeks news and updates to the game, keeping their community up to date with everything going on in Destiny 2. The
                footer and header also holds a lot of important information and links.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>The header text is still clear despite being over top a video. 
                    The text on the bottom is light on a dark background creating 
                    an easy reading experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>The colors and the fonts are consistent despite there 
                    being slight variations from each other like bolded letters and different color shades.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The margins and padding are consistent throughout and all the buttons are visible.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>All related information is in close proximity of each other. The header 
                    dropdown menus are clear and intuitive.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="evaluation-text">Zara is a fast-fashion clothing website that offers a wide selection of high-quality looking clothing with 
                a variety of styles and colors. Many of the clothing articles at ZARA are inspired by the latest fashion trends.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>The headers are small compared to the page and so is a lot of the text on the page. </li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>The images showing the clothing are inconsistent throught the page. Some images are large and there is only one on a line
                while others are small with multiple on one line.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>With the images, some of them are large and centered, some large and left justified.
                The nav bar also sometimes appears over dark colors and is hard to see.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Despite the inconsistencies, the related information is in close proximity to each other. </li>
