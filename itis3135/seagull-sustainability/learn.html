            <h4>Bottle Labels</h4>
            <p>The article explains the difference between recycled labels (made from reused materials) and recyclable labels (designed to be processed by recycling facilities). It emphasizes choosing the right materials, adhesives, and inks to ensure packaging is fully recyclable and encourages educating consumers on proper recycling practices.</p>

            <h4>Adhesive Removal</h4>
            <p>When labels aren't removed before recycling, the adhesives can contaminate the recycling process, leading to downcycling or disposal in landfills. To address this, the article suggests using wash-off adhesives that detach during recycling, allowing for cleaner recovery of materials.</p>

        <p>Lunar dust is one of the most prevalent issues in astronaut safety. Unlike dust on Earth,
          lunar dust carries a strong electric charge and has sharp edges, posing as a serious risk
          to astronauts. As they step through the lunar surface, their suits build with charge
          transferred from the lunar surface. Eventually, it leads to a shock for the astronaut.
          One day, we can see our Simply Sea film creating a Faraday’s cage for the
          astronauts. The polarity, flexibility, and small pore size of our Simply Sea film could
          make for a durable, out-of-the-world solution to lunar dust!</p>

            <h4>Faraday Cage</h4>
            <p>The video uses a Van de Graaff generator to show how a Faraday cage protects against electric fields. A figure representing Benjamin Franklin is struck by simulated lightning outside the cage but stays safe inside, illustrating why cars offer protection during storms.</p>

            <h4>Dust Shield</h4>
            <p>NASA’s Electrodynamic Dust Shield uses electric fields to repel lunar dust from surfaces such as glass and radiators. Successfully tested on the Moon, the technology clears up to 98% of dust in seconds. This innovation is crucial for protecting future lunar habitats and equipment.
