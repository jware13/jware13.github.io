          At Seagull, we are breaking the green premium in the sustainable
          materials sector by not working for alternatives to plastics, but
          replacements. Pervasive microplastics are implacting ecosystems across
          the world with a particularly diminishing impact on our ocean's (link
          to ocean cleanup page). The way we see it, the fastest way to save our
          ocean is by inventing the biodegradable replacements for plastics that
          a consumer won't think twice about.
